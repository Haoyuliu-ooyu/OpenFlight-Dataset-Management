Week 4
6th Dec - 11th Dec.
This week is the most challenging week we've ever had.
We accomplished the Floyd-Warshall algorithms and applied it to out test cases, partial data of our choose, and the whole big dataset.
We also finished the visualization algorithms, where we found that drawing lines on pixels using Bresenham algorithm is a challengin and interesting work.
Till now the whole code part of the project is finished.
